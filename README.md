Interactive steering and visualization tool for neural network simulations in neuroscience

This repository contains scripts to perform interactive steering and visualization of simulations with structural plasticity in the NEST simulator (nest-simulator.org, https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator).

Scripts for three examples are provided: 
1. A simple example with a two population network, one excitatory and one inhibitory
2. An example with 68 regions, each formed by two populations, one excitatory and one inhibitory
3. An example based in the cortical microcircuit (Potjans, Tobias C., and Markus Diesmann. "The cell-type specific cortical microcircuit: relating structure and activity in a full-scale spiking network model." Cerebral cortex 24.3 (2012): 785-806.)
